### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this lesson I learned about the Document Object Model (DOM) and how it contains the contents within a document of a browser. I used the DOM methods to create nodes. 
2. I learned about Dynamic HTML and learned how to interact on a webpage without it constantly reloading. The assignment showed me this directly with creating the elements to click left and right to view other photos. 
3. The DOM tree displayed the nodes of HTML in a tree to understand the hierarhy better. I learned that element, attribute and text content are all nodes and part of the DOM tree.
